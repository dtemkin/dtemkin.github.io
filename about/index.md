## Bio

Recently, graduated from Denver University with a Master's in Data Science. When
I am not looking for my next employment opportunity my time is pretty evenly divided between
my own data projects, some diy tech projects and driving a Zamboni on the weekends.

I also like watching movies and cooking the occasional meal.
