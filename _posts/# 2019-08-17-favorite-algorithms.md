## Stable Marriage

    - 


## Knapsack Optimization

    - Optimize Value/Weight


## Edit Distance (Damerau-Levenshtein Distance)

    - String Distance using number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions and transpositions) it takes to transform one string into another
    - Good for a simple fuzzy matching of strings
    - Implemented in NLTK
    
## Timsort

    - "Adaptive" Sorting Algorithm derived from insertion and merge sort
    - Default sorting algorithm used in Python

## DBSCAN/OPTICS

    - Clustering without specifying the number of clusters at initialization
    - Good for clustering when groups are not well defined or known 


### Honorable Mention

## Best Schedule

    - Suboptimal algorithm Earliest Deadline First
